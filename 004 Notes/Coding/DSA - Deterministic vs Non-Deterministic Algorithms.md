# Deterministic vs Non-Deterministic Algorithms

## Description

Algorithms can be classified based on predictability.

### Deterministic Algorithms

- Given the same input, always produce the same output.
- Follow a predictable sequence of steps.

### Non-Deterministic Algorithms

- May produce different outputs or follow different paths for the same input.
- Often theoretical in classical computing contexts.
- Common in probabilistic or heuristic approaches.
