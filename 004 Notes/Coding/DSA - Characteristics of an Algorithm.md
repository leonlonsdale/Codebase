# Characteristics of an Algorithm

## Description

An algorithm typically has the following properties:

- **Input** – Zero or more externally supplied values
- **Output** – At least one result
- **Definiteness** – Each step is precisely defined
- **Finiteness** – Must terminate after a finite number of steps
- **Effectiveness** – Each step must be basic enough to execute

These properties distinguish algorithms from vague instructions or informal procedures.
