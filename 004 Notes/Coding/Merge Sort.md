# Merge Sort


## How it works

- A divide and conquer recursive sorting algorithm.
- It recursively divides the list in half until the length is 1
- All lists of length 1 are considered sorted.
- Two sorted lists are passed to a merging function which combines the lists into a single sorted list and returns it.
- This happens recursively until the array is reconstructed in order.

## Pseudocode

### `merge()` Function Pseudocode

1. Create an empty list called `results` to store the merged elements.
2. Set two pointers `i` and `j` to 0 (these will be used to traverse the left and right sub-lists).
3. While both pointers `i` and `j` are within bounds of their respective sub-lists:
   - If the element at `left[i]` is smaller or equal to `right[j]`:
     - Add `left[i]` to `results`.
     - Increment `i` by 1.
   - Otherwise:
     - Add `right[j]` to `results`.
     - Increment `j` by 1.
4. Once one sub-list is exhausted (i.e., either `i` or `j` goes out of bounds):
   - Add the remaining elements of the `left` sub-list (from `i` onwards) to `results`.
   - Add the remaining elements of the `right` sub-list (from `j` onwards) to `results`.
5. Return the `results` list, which contains the merged and sorted elements.

### `merge_sort()` Function Pseudocode

1. If the list has fewer than two elements (i.e., it is either empty or contains one element):
   - Return the list (it is already sorted).
2. Otherwise:
   - Find the middle index of the list.
   - Divide the list into two halves: `left` and `right`.
3. Recursively apply `merge_sort()` to both the `left` and `right` sub-lists.
4. Once both sub-lists are sorted:
   - Call the `merge()` function to merge the two sorted sub-lists.
5. Return the merged and sorted list.

## Examples

```python
def merge(left,right):
	results = []
	i = j = 0

	while i < len(left) and j < len(right):
		if left[i] <= right[j]:
			results.append(left[i])
			i += 1
		else:
			results.append(right[j])
			j += 1

	results.extend(left[i:])
	results.extend(right[j:])

	return results

def merge_sort(arr):

	if len(arr) < 2:
		return arr

	mid = len(arr) // 2

	return merge(merge_sort(arr[:mid]), merge_sort(arr[mid:]))
```

## Complexity

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of merge sort is $O(n \log(n))$.

- **Divide Step:** The list is recursively split in half. This happens at each level, creating a binary tree structure with a depth of $\log(n)$.
- **Merge Step:** At each level of the recursion tree, merging the sorted sub-arrays requires processing every element in the array. When you sum the work done by all merge operations at a given level, the total merging work is, $O(n)$.  The merge step is performed at each level of recursion, and across all levels, the total work is $O(n \log n)$.
### Space Complexity

The space complexity of merge sort is $O(n)$, and here's why:

- **Auxiliary Space for Merging:**  
  During the merge step, merge sort requires extra space to store the left and right sub-arrays. These sub-arrays are created as temporary lists to store the split parts of the original array. While merging, new lists are formed by combining the elements from these temporary sub-arrays.  
  Since the merge step combines all elements in the array at each level, the total space used at any point is proportional to the size of the original array.

- **Recursive Call Stack:**  
  Merge sort is a recursive algorithm, meaning it uses a call stack. In the worst case, the depth of the recursion tree is $\log(n)$ (since the array is split in half each time). However, this doesn't increase the space complexity because the recursion only uses space proportional to the number of sub-arrays being merged at each level, which is still $O(n)$ overall.

Therefore, even though the recursion depth is $\log(n)$, the main factor contributing to space complexity is the additional space used for temporary sub-arrays during the merging process. This results in a total space complexity of **$O(n)$**.
