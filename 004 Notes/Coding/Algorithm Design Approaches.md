# Algorithm Design Approaches

## Description

Algorithms can be categorised by their design strategy.

Common approaches include:

- **Brute Force** – Try all possible solutions
- **Divide and Conquer** – Break the problem into smaller sub-problems
- **Greedy** – Make the locally optimal choice at each step
- **Dynamic Programming** – Store results of subproblems to avoid recomputation
- **Backtracking** – Explore possible solutions and undo choices when necessary

These approaches influence both time and space complexity.
