# Logarithms in Computer Science

## Description

In Big O notation, logarithms are assumed to be base 2 unless otherwise stated.

A logarithm roughly measures how many times a number can be divided by 2 before reaching 1.

Logarithmic complexity commonly appears in:

- Binary search
- Efficient sorting algorithms
- Certain recursive algorithms

## Examples

log₂(8) = 3  
2 raised to what power equals 8?
