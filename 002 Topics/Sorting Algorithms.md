# Sorting Algorithms

## Description

This topic covers **sorting algorithms**, which are methods to **reorder collections of items** according to a defined order (usually ascending or descending).

It includes **classic algorithms** such as Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort. Each algorithm is broken down into:

- **How it works** → plain-language explanation
- **Pseudocode** → step-by-step process
- **Example Code** → working implementation
- **Complexity** → time and space analysis

Sorting algorithms are essential for **efficient searching, data processing, and algorithmic problem solving**.
